        <h1>Privacy Policy for QR Scanner Hub</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how QR Scanner Hub ("the App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the QR Scanner Hub mobile application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>QR Scanner Hub is designed with your privacy in mind. We are committed to providing a secure and private experience. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information or personal data from our users.** This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or any contact information.</li>
            <li>Your location data.</li>
            <li>Your device identifiers.</li>
            <li>Any data generated from QR code scans (text, URLs, etc.).</li>
            <li>Any images from your gallery.</li>
            <li>Usage data or analytics about how you use the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All QR code scanning, generation, and related operations occur entirely on your device. No data leaves your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Permissions Used by the App</h2>
        <p>For the App to function correctly, it requires access to certain device capabilities. These permissions are used solely for the intended functionality of the App and are not used to collect personal data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Access (`android.permission.CAMERA`):</strong> Required to scan QR codes and barcodes using your device's camera. The App accesses the camera stream locally for scanning and does not record or transmit video/images.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Access (`android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - for older Android versions; `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` for Android 13+):</strong> Required to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Select images from your device's gallery for scanning.</li>
                    <li>Save generated QR codes as image files to your device's photo gallery.</li>
                </ul>
                The App only accesses files explicitly chosen by you (for gallery scan) or created by the App (for saving). It does not scan your storage for other files.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vibration Control (`android.permission.VIBRATE`):</strong> Used to provide haptic feedback (vibration) when a QR code is successfully scanned, if enabled in the App's settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since QR Scanner Hub does not collect or transmit any personal data, the risk of your data being compromised by us is eliminated. All operations, including scanning, generating, and saving QR codes, are processed locally on your device, ensuring maximum privacy and security.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
