        <h1>Privacy Policy for QR Scanner Hub</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how QR Scanner Hub ("the App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the QR Scanner Hub mobile application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>QR Scanner Hub is designed with your privacy in mind. We are committed to providing a secure and private experience. <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information or personal data from our users.</strong> This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or any contact information.</li>
            <li>Your location data.</li>
            <li>Your device identifiers.</li>
            <li>Any data generated from QR code scans (text, URLs, etc.).</li>
            <li>Any images from your gallery.</li>
            <li>Usage data or analytics about how you use the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All QR code scanning, generation, and related operations occur entirely on your device. No data leaves your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Permissions Used by the App</h2>
        <p>To ensure full functionality, the App requires access to specific features of your device. These permissions are solely used for the operation of the App and do not involve any data collection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> Used to scan QR codes and barcodes in real-time using your deviceâ€™s camera. The app does not capture, record, or transmit any images or video.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage or Gallery Access:</strong> Allows you to select images from your device for scanning, and save generated QR codes to your device. Only files explicitly chosen or created by the App are accessed.</li>
            <li><strong>Vibration:</strong> Used to provide haptic feedback (vibration) when a QR code is successfully scanned, if this feature is enabled in the App settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since QR Scanner Hub does not collect or transmit any personal data, the risk of your data being compromised is effectively eliminated. All features are executed locally on your device, ensuring a secure and private experience.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Users are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed. All changes become effective once posted.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
